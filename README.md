# GIS Frontend Practice Project: Interactive Map Explorer

## Overview
This project is designed to help you practice and enhance your frontend development skills using **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, **SASS**, **Azure Maps**, and **OpenLayers**. You will build an interactive web application that allows users to explore and interact with maps, visualize geospatial data, and switch between different map providers.

   - Allow users to switch between Azure Maps and OpenLayers as the map provider.

2. **Map Controls**:
   - Add zoom in/out buttons.
   - Include a geolocation button to center the map on the user's current location.
   - Add a layer control to toggle between different map layers (e.g., satellite, street view).

3. **Geospatial Data Visualization**:
   - Display markers, polygons, and lines on the map.
   - Fetch and visualize geospatial data from a public API (e.g., GeoJSON data).

4. **Search and Location**:
   - Implement a search bar to find and zoom to specific locations.
   - Display a popup with location details when a marker is clicked.

5. **Custom Styling**:
   - Use **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling.
